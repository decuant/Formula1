## Features

Scan in multiple directories and with multiple Filters and Excluded Filters.
Calls grep for each file found.

Divide options using ";", like ```h.*;cpp.*```

Double click on "File Filters" or "Grep Text" will open the History dialog for each. Here you can pick an old test.

Clicking a file on the list will perform a new grep over it, thus changing the grep text and clicking again on the file will refresh the view with new results.

Byte alignment is provided as exclusive single option.




## Installation

Make a folder in "Program Files" for a 64 bits installation, in "Program Files (x86)" otherwise.

Make a directory of your choice, an example "Formula1_64"

Copy the Release files over and eventually pick the executable and pin it to the taskbar.


## Issues

Seldom the indexing is not valid.


## Updates

This is a very old application, back dates to 2006. No further updates are foreseen.
